# JavaScript Calculator :iphone:

As a pre-course practical project for the **Founders&Coders** course, I had to create a JavaScript calculator following the pre-course materials and making sure that I cement the knowledge of the following concepts:


- [x] Use the command line applying git commands.
- [x] Understand the purpose of using Git and GitHub.
- [x] Know the markdown syntax to create README files like this one.
- [x] Be familiar with new HTML5 (semantic) elements.
- [x] Understand CSS rules.
- [x] Understand what the DOM is.
- [x] Host the project on GitHub pages.
- [x] DON'T use frameworks.

Here's a sneak-peek to my calculator:
